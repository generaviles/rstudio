I am making this notebook as evidence of my grow in the use of R for analysis of medical related data. I hope one day I will look back at it and find it amussing.

## MRI Images in R

This excercise is based on a tutorial published by [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/visualization-of-mri-data-in-r/). I will be trying to reproduce what the present on their post.
We will be using the `oro.nifti` package to read into R these images.

```{r}
library(oro.nifti)
img <- readNIfTI("Template-T1-U8-RALPFH-BR.nii.gz", reorient = FALSE)
class(img)
## [1] "nifti"
## attr(,"package")
## [1] "oro.nifti"
dim(img)
## [1] 182 512 512

```

### Visualizing the images

`oro.nifti` comes with a function called `image` that allows to plot a specific slice from the MRI, the following command plots the 225th axial slice of ***img***:

```{r}
image(img, z = 225, plot.type= "single")

```



The same command can be used to pull all available slices in ***img***, next to each other. In this particular case, it turns out to be not very practical.
```{r}
image(img)
```


### Displaying an Orthographic Projection

The function `orthographic` from the same `oro.nifti` library can be use to give an overview in 2D of the 3D structure of the brain.
```{r}
orthographic(img)
```

### Getting Fancy

There are other more ellaborate functions that can be accomplished with other packages, like `neurobase`. This packages has the `ortho2` as an improved function to `orthographic`. On the following example an overlay of the brain as a semitransparent layer on to of the original is generated.

```{r}
library(neurobase)
library(scales)
ortho2(img, img, col.y = alpha("red", 0.3))

```






This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
